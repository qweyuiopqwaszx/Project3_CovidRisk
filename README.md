# Project3_CovidRisk
Data_mining_Project3 by Jake and Blake


Our final project sets to quickly sort people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in order of how likely they are to develop severe complications to the virus. We defined severe complications as being either hospitalized or dying from the virus. We utilize datasets provided by Two Rivers Public Health Department in Central Nebraska, all of which can be obtained by submitted a FOIA request directly to the department. Using demographic variables and information about a patient's symptoms and pre-existing conditions, we can quickly identify those most at risk. Our algorithm is intended for use by medical professionals and public health workers to identify these at-risk populations and provide them with quality carte before severe outcomes occur.
